# VS Code Instance Rename

A simple VS Code extension that allows you to rename VS Code window instances for easier identification when running multiple instances in parallel.

## Features

- **Rename Window Title**: Use the command palette to set a custom title for your VS Code instance
- **Persistent Titles**: Titles are saved in workspace settings and persist across sessions
- **Easy Window Switching**: Quickly identify which VS Code instance you need when Alt+Tabbing

## Usage

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Rename VS Code Instance"
3. Enter your desired title
4. The window title will update immediately

## Why This Extension?

When running multiple VS Code instances with various AI agents or different workspaces, it can be difficult to identify which window is which:
- Branch names are too small in the UI
- Peacock colors have limited differentiation at a glance
- Workspace paths aren't descriptive enough

A custom window title shows up prominently when switching windows (Alt+Tab), making it easy to find the instance you need.

## Installation

Install from the VS Code Marketplace or build from source.
